# Unveiling Hidden Customer Segments: An EDA of E-commerce Purchase Behavior

## Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on e-commerce sales data to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchase patterns and product preferences.  The analysis aims to uncover hidden insights that can be leveraged to optimize targeted marketing campaigns and improve overall business strategy.  The EDA involves data cleaning, descriptive statistics, visualization, and potential clustering techniques to reveal meaningful customer segmentations.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (potentially, depending on clustering methods used)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key descriptive statistics and insights to the console, summarizing the findings of the EDA.  Additionally, the analysis generates several visualization files (e.g., plots showing sales trends, product popularity, customer segmentation, etc.)  These files will be saved in the project directory.  The specific output files may vary depending on the chosen visualization methods.  Example output files might include: `sales_trend.png`, `product_popularity.png`, `customer_segments.png`.  The exact filenames and visualizations will be described in the `main.py` script comments.
